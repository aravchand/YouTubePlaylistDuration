# YouTubePlaylistDuration
I wanted to be able to quickly find the total time it would take me to watch a playlist on YouTube.
So, I decided to make a google chrome extension that will show the total duration of the playlist and some other useful metrics of the playlist.
This will require usage of YT API, Google Chrome Extension, and Python + HTML/CSS/JavaScript technologies.

First, I needed to get to get down basic usage of the YT API, so I decided to make this learning program in Python.
In Python, I made the main functionality of the program: Requesting from the API, analyzing and interpreting its Responses, and totalling the durations of the videos in a given playlist. To make this program more usable, I made a continuous loop allowing the user to find the total time of as many playlists as they please, inputting through terminal.

Next, I will implement this into a Google Chrome Extension. This will use HTML/CS/JS and specific Extension concepts.
